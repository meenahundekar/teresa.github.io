                <h2>Mother Teresa: Early Life and Family </h2>
            
                
                <p><b>
                    Born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, the current capital of the Republic of Macedonia, 
                    Mother Teresa was baptized the following day as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhui. Her parents,
                    Nikola and Dranafile Bojaxhui were of Albanian Descent. Her father worked as a 
                    construction contractor and a trader of medicines. Nikola was a vocal proponent involved 
                    in the local church as well as in city politics. In 1919, her father died due to unknown 
                    reasons while there were speculations that he was poisoned by political enemies. Later, 
                    Agnes became attached to her mother who instilled in her a deep commitment to charity.

                <h2>Mother Teresa Education</h2>
                <p><b>Agnes went to a convent-run primary school and then a state-run secondary school. She used to sing solos in the local Sacred Heart choir and from there she first felt a calling to religious life at the age of 12. Six years later, in 1928, an 18-year-old Agnes decided to become a nun and set off for Ireland to join the sisters of Loreto in Dublin. It was there that she took the name Sister Mary Teresa after Saint Theresa of Liseux.</b> </p>
